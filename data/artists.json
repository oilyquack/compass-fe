In 2024, he released three strikingly varied singles — “Disco Kid,” “Chatter Box,” and “Come Baby Burn” — each exploring different corners of his eclectic sound, from jagged indie rock to brooding electronic textures.  Now based in Folkestone, Kent, Joe operates out of his home studio, where he is currently finishing work on his debut solo record. On May 9th he released his 4th single ”Ugly Boy”. The accompanying music video was shot at the Folkestone Quarterhouse when Joe and his band supported the Rifles on their nationwide tour. Joe's next single is ”It's In the Bag”, and will be out June 20th. Originally from London, Joe draws deeply from an array of influences, blending the raw energy of Queens of the Stone Age and Fat Dog, the cinematic depth of Radiohead and Nick Cave, and the offbeat charm of Mac DeMarco and Tom Waits. His sound sits at the intersection of Alternative Rock, Indie, and Electronica, underscoring lyrics that are introspective, darkly humorous, and sometimes surreal.",

A Kafka vs. Cthulhu love story set to a soundscape of David Lynch surrealism. They’ll turn your existential dread  into a party.  Pablo Paganotto (Sassyhiya, Mookherjee), Greg Webster (Sonaura) and Joe Wise (Frau Pouch) have been crafting sonic architecture for the disaffected South England set for years. A polyamorous marriage of technical brilliance, catchy complexity and unadulterated energy, these London/Kent scene veterans deliver. As individuals they’ve been instrumental in cultivating DIY networks for performance and amplifying quieter creative voices. As a band, Punching Swans are prolific, proficient and always ready to release the next colossal Kraken.",

Star Trash wasn’t always the engine of demonic chaos he is today—he was simply the wrong man in the right place, desperate to find meaning in a universe that was, apparently, devoid of a plan. A rare celestial event would push Aaron ‘Face’ Taylor beyond this realm, imbuing him with the ability to tap into the raw material that is the true source of all things in the universe: pure chaos. Were he more deserving, he could have used this power for good, but Aaron was tainted—a flawed product of his life experience. Rejected by his elders, despised by peers, betrayed by those closest to him and stepped on by the society he tried to call home, the chaos embedded itself on the dark seeds of his soul and began to spread…",

But there’s also something strange at work here. Far from content to ape her be-dazzled Studio 54 idols, Fairy adds something new to the mix. It’s a bittersweet, playful, wistful sensibility that works itself out in a sound that both reveres and toys with the music she loves with all her heart.    Though she sparkles on record, Vanity Fairy is undeniably best experienced live.  ‘A spectacle in the truest sense of the word, her show spans high camp theatrics, 80’s indebted synth-pop and sultry disco bangers… unavoidably infectious and utterly joy inducing’ - DIY.",

I was a founding member of Mystery Jets, touring and releasing albums between 2005 and 2019, then since 2019 I’ve been focusing on a solo album, have relocated to Margate, set up the monthly Song Salon music night as well as co-writing and gigging alongside many of the amazing musicians I’ve met since moving here. A little bit about the Song Salon… it’s a music night/hub for artists to meet and share their works in progress, starting back in 2021 at the Tom Thumb, it runs on the last Thursday of every month and invites and encourages music makers of all description to share what they’re working on, stuck on, unable to finish or are buzzing and excited about. It’s been a great incentive for me to have a new song written every month and it’s been really cool to see collaboration formed from people who have met at the night, bands, albums, songs, have all been born out of the connections formed at the Salon…as I’m sure you’ll agree it’s testament to the wealth of artistic talent we have around these parts. How about a Song Salon in Folkestone ?!",

Their music traverses a vivid spectrum of styles—an eclectic tapestry of ethereal shoegaze, driving post-punk energy, and a brooding gothic undertone. At its core lies a powerful sense of emotional depth, with lyrics that evoke a haunting, cryptic intimacy, wrapping listeners in a kaleidoscopic dreamscape of sound.  Since their inception, Winter Gardens have steadily built a reputation for their distinctive sound and captivating live performances, sharing stages with iconic acts such as Echo & The Bunnymen, Gary Numan, Modern English, Piroshka, and Pale Blue Eyes. They've become a staple on the UK festival circuit, including a standout performance at Rockaway Beach 2024 alongside OMD, Self Esteem, and Peter Hook & The Light.  This year marks an exciting evolution for the band, with the formation of a bold new lineup bringing renewed creative confidence. 2024 has seen Winter Gardens venture beyond UK borders, performing across Europe at acclaimed festivals like Left Of The Dial and Supersonic. Their rising profile has been matched by increasing radio support, including airplay on BBC Radio 1, BBC Introducing, and Seattle’s influential KEXP.",
