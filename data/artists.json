In 2024, he released three strikingly varied singles — “Disco Kid,” “Chatter Box,” and “Come Baby Burn” — each exploring different corners of his eclectic sound, from jagged indie rock to brooding electronic textures.  Now based in Folkestone, Kent, Joe operates out of his home studio, where he is currently finishing work on his debut solo record. On May 9th he released his 4th single ”Ugly Boy”. The accompanying music video was shot at the Folkestone Quarterhouse when Joe and his band supported the Rifles on their nationwide tour. Joe's next single is ”It's In the Bag”, and will be out June 20th. Originally from London, Joe draws deeply from an array of influences, blending the raw energy of Queens of the Stone Age and Fat Dog, the cinematic depth of Radiohead and Nick Cave, and the offbeat charm of Mac DeMarco and Tom Waits. His sound sits at the intersection of Alternative Rock, Indie, and Electronica, underscoring lyrics that are introspective, darkly humorous, and sometimes surreal.",

But there’s also something strange at work here. Far from content to ape her be-dazzled Studio 54 idols, Fairy adds something new to the mix. It’s a bittersweet, playful, wistful sensibility that works itself out in a sound that both reveres and toys with the music she loves with all her heart.    Though she sparkles on record, Vanity Fairy is undeniably best experienced live.  ‘A spectacle in the truest sense of the word, her show spans high camp theatrics, 80’s indebted synth-pop and sultry disco bangers… unavoidably infectious and utterly joy inducing’ - DIY.",
