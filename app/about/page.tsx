          <p className="mg-btm-sm">
            Compass Festival is Folkestoneâ€™s alternative, independent music
            festival, rooted in DIY ethos, activist spirit, and community
            passion. Founded and produced by Compass Music, now a registered
            Community Interest Company (CIC) as of June 2025, we exist not just
            as a not-for-profit, but as a mission-driven organisation dedicated
            to championing emerging, unsigned artists from Kent, Sussex, and the
            South Coast.
          </p>
          <p className="mg-btm-sm">
            Held in the vibrant seaside town of Folkestone, the festival brings
            together 35+ boundary-pushing artists across indie, alt pop, folk,
            post-punk, indie rock, live electronic, singer-songwriters and more.
            With two packed showcase days (17â€“18 October), Compass is more than
            just gigs; itâ€™s about building bridges between artists, audiences,
            and the town itself.
          </p>
          <p className="mg-btm-sm">
            Born from personal experience and love for live music, Compass is
            shaped by founder Geraldine Zanaskaâ€™s lifelong passion â€” from going
            to underground gigs in Paris as a teenager to attending 3â€“5 live
            shows a week pre-pandemic â€” and a frustration with a music world
            dominated by major labels and streaming algorithms. Moving to
            Folkestone, Geraldine saw the townâ€™s untapped potential and its
            wildly supportive crowds, and began creating spaces like Riot Gulll
            and Nu Wave to showcase women, gender-diverse, and new and upcoming
            artists from the region. Compass Festival builds on this: offering a
            platform for independent music, fostering collaboration, and
            becoming a cultural meeting point where audiences come open to
            discovery.

          <h2 className="mg-btm-md">Our Mission + Vision</h2>
          <p className="mg-btm-sm">
            At Compass Festival, we believe independent music is more than
            entertainment; itâ€™s a force for community, connection, and change.
            Our mission is to amplify the voices of grassroots artists,
            spotlight alternative and underrepresented talent, and create
            inclusive, affordable, and joyful spaces where live music thrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            We envision a music ecosystem where human curation matters again â€”
            where people come for the experience, not the algorithm; where
            independent voices are heard alongside one another; and where
            Folkestone becomes a proud catalyst for Kent and the South Coastâ€™s
            diverse and exciting sound. Our values are grounded in fairness,
            inclusivity, gender balance, and an unshakeable love for the DIY and
            grassroots scene.

          <h2 className="mg-btm-md">Why Folkestone?</h2>
          <p className="mg-btm-sm">
            Folkestone is a small seaside fishing town with a big creative
            heart. It was named the UKâ€™s best place to visit in 2025 by Time
            Out, voted best place to live in the South East by the Sunday Times
            in 2024, and recognized by Lonely Planet as one of the best regions
            to visit in 2022 as part of Kentâ€™s Heritage Coast.
          </p>
          <p className="mg-btm-sm">
            Itâ€™s a place where art has sparked regeneration, most notably
            through the Folkestone Triennial â€” the UKâ€™s largest display of
            public contemporary art, running this year from 19 July and with its
            closing weekend coinciding with Compass Festival!
          </p>
          <p>
            With its independent spirit, curious audiences, and quick links to
            London, Folkestone is the perfect home for a festival dedicated to
            discovery, human connection, and grassroots culture.
